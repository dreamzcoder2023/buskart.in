        <p>This policy outlines the process for deleting your account on Buskart.</p>

        <h3>How to Request Account Deletion</h3>
        <p>There are two ways to request deletion of your account:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>In-App Deletion (if available):</strong> Some versions of our app may offer an account deletion option within the app settings. You can check your app settings for this option.</li>
            <li><strong>Contacting Customer Support:</strong> If in-app deletion is not available, you can request account deletion by contacting our customer support team. Here's how:
                <ul>
                    <li>Open the app and navigate to the Help or Support section.</li>
                    <li>Look for contact options like email address, phone number, or a live chat option.</li>
                    <li>Clearly state your request to delete your account and all associated data.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Account Deletion Process</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Upon receiving your deletion request (via in-app option or customer support), we will verify your identity for security reasons. This may involve confirming your email address or phone number associated with the account.</li>
            <li>Once verification is complete, we will process your deletion request within 7 business days.</li>
            <li>Deleting your account is an irreversible action. Once your account is deleted, all associated data, including your ride history, payment information, and location data, will be permanently removed from our system.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Important Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Legal Obligations:</strong> We may be required by law to retain some information for a specific period. This may include transaction records for tax purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>Confirmation Email:</strong> After successful account deletion, you will receive a confirmation email sent to the address associated with your account.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Contact Us</h3>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns about account deletion, please don't hesitate to contact our customer support team through the <a href="mailto:doozyinfosoftwaresolutions@gmail.com">doozyinfosoftwaresolutions@gmail.com</a>.</p>
